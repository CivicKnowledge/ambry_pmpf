Design Improvements

Speed and performance could probably be improved a lot by running the Stats and
Intuition processes while the MPR file is being loaded. This could be done
efficiently by re-implementing the main load_rows() loop in Cython

The stats could be re-implemented in Cython, since livestats.py is a single
file. The Python code for stats should determine what the LOM is for each
column, then the stats code in the loop could be very simple.

The TypeIntuiter could be simplified and incorporated into the file format by
making space in the file for counts of each type and each row. The MPR file
would handle figuring a type for each value in each column, and storing the
counts in the file. Then, after the run, the Type Intuiter could determine
resolved types.

The RowIntuiter could probably be sped up by having the Type Intuiter generate
'pictures' of the first 100 and last 100 rows, or maybe just storing the
type values in a buffer for the start, and a ring-buffer at the end. Then,
generate the pictures and data-pattern in post-processing.

Writing could be sped up by creating a custom implementation of the msgpack
distribution's _packer.pyx file. The custom version would only work on
arrays of arrays

Could also incorporate a basic Type caster, on both input and output

Performance Improvements

Compared to MPR, The HDF% Format, via PyTables, is astonishingly fast, but
only when appending many rows at a time. When appending only one row at a,
it is comparable to MPR. This is probably because when appending a lot of
rows, the rows are iterated in C. We could probably perform a similar
improvement in MPR.

In this case, we'd have an insert_rows() method that would insert a large block of rows.
The reader would have to understand that if the first element of an array is another array,
it is interpreted as a collection of rows, not a single row. Or, we could write the rows in C.

Additionally, BLOSC compression seems to be significantly faster.
